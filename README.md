# PRODIGY_CS_02
This task focuses on encrypting an image at the pixel level using cryptographic algorithms. The process involves modifying pixel values to secure the image, making it unreadable without the appropriate decryption key. The goal is to understand image encryption techniques and enhance security for digital images.
